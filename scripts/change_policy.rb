# acceptable), but a hook cannot act on prose, so the machine-checkable subset
# lives in a `change_policy:` YAML frontmatter block, alongside the
# `change_config:` block the audit lanes read. The body is the source of truth a
# person reads; the frontmatter is the same policy stated in a form the merge
