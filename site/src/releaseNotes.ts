// Human-readable release notes for the CHANGE.md frontmatter spec.
//
// Deliberately separate from the spec text itself. The spec's own "Changelog"
// section is written for someone implementing against the schema and reads like
// a field-set delta; this is written for someone deciding whether a version
// affects them, and says what changed, why, and what they have to do about it.
//
// One entry per version that has something to say. A version with no entry
// simply renders no panel, so adding a version here is optional and never a
// build-time requirement. Keyed by the exact version string used in
// src/spec.ts's VERSIONS, so the current version and every archived version
// resolve their own notes and never each other's.
