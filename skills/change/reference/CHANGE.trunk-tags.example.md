# A complete, copy-paste CHANGE.md for a trunk + tag release topology (schema
# 0.8.0): one long-lived branch, main, with higher environments named
# by release tags (staging/v1.4.0, production/v1.4.0) instead of long-lived
# staging/production branches. Copy this file to <repo-root>/CHANGE.md and
# edit; for the branch-per-environment default, start from CHANGE.template.md
# instead. See the frontmatter spec's "change_policy tag rules" section for
# the full field reference this file uses.
#
# The tag: rules below are validated by `change_config.rb doctor` and
# enforced at push time by `change_tag_guard.rb`: publishing a matching tag
# with no recorded passing run for that commit is denied. Run
# `change_run.rb all --for-tag <tagname>` against the commit being tagged
# first (it sweeps the right profile against the right commit), or
# `change_run.rb gate-status --ref <tagname>` to check without running
# anything, then push the tag.

# Change management for my-app

The straight-answer governance FAQ for this repo. Point a teammate here when
they ask how a change reaches production, whether every release needs a
review, or whether an author can cut their own release.

## Git flow

One long-lived branch, `main`. Work happens on short-lived feature branches
and lands on `main` by squash-merged PR. There are no `staging` or
`production` branches. A release to a higher environment is a tag pushed at a
commit already on `main`: `staging/v1.4.0`, then `production/v1.4.0` at that
same commit once it has been verified in staging. Deploys are triggered by
the tag, not by change-fabric; this file gates the release, it does not
perform it.

## What is required before promoting to each environment

- To `main`: a reviewed PR, CI green, and a passing comprehensive `cf:change`
  run for the head commit under the `local` profile.
- To staging: run `cf:change` against the exact commit being tagged, then
  push the tag `staging/v1.4.0`. The commit must already be on `main`.
- To production: the same, tagging `production/v1.4.0`, and the commit must
  already carry a `staging/v*` tag (this is what `require_prior_tag` states
  machine-checkably above).

## Who can review, and is self-review allowed

- Merging to `main`: any teammate may review; the author may not merge their
  own change without a second approval.
- Cutting a `staging/v*` tag: the author who merged to `main` may cut it
  themselves; no second review is required, since the audit gate is the real
  check.
- Cutting a `production/v*` tag: requires a second person's review of the
  release itself (not just the original merge), stated by
  `self_review_allowed: false` above.

## When admin-bypass merging is and is not acceptable

Not used in this repo. There is no `staging`/`production` branch to
admin-merge into; a release is a tag push, which this file gates on the
recorded audit for that exact commit rather than on a merge-time bypass.

## What CI gates each stage

- Merging to `main`: lint, typecheck, unit tests, build.
- Tagging `staging/v*`: the same `ci.yml` run that already gated the merge to
  `main`, re-verified for the exact commit being tagged.
- Tagging `production/v*`: lint, typecheck, unit tests, e2e, build, all green
  for the exact commit being tagged.
